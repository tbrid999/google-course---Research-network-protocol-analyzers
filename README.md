Wireshark: Offers a graphical user interface (GUI), making it easier for users to navigate and analyze packets visually.
tcpdump: Operates solely on the command line, requiring users to be familiar with CLI commands.
Depth of Analysis:

Wireshark: Provides deep packet inspection and allows users to follow streams and view detailed protocol decodes.
tcpdump: Focuses on packet capture and filtering, displaying packet summaries in real-time but without detailed analysis.
Similarities Between Wireshark and tcpdump:
Open-Source: Both tools are open-source, making them accessible to anyone.
Packet Capturing: Both can capture live network traffic for analysis.
Filter Usage: Both tools allow the use of filters to focus on specific types of network traffic.
